00:00:52,337 --> 00:00:57,269
<i>Imperial Diary.
Year 10,191. Third comment.</i>

2
00:01:00,211 --> 00:01:04,045
<i>The battle for Arrakis
took everyone by surprise.</i>

3
00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:05,979
<i>There were no witnesses.</i>

4
00:01:08,121 --> 00:01:11,118
<i>The Harkonnen operation
was perpetrated overnight,</i>

5
00:01:11,253 --> 00:01:15,320
<i>without warning or
declaration of war.</i>

6
00:01:17,293 --> 00:01:20,028
<i>By morning, the
Atreides were no more.</i>

7
00:01:21,567 --> 00:01:22,932
<i>All died in the dark.</i>

8
00:01:31,742 --> 00:01:33,404
<i>And the Emperor said...</i>

9
00:01:36,777 --> 00:01:37,848
<i>nothing.</i>

10
00:01:40,219 --> 00:01:42,919
<i>Since that night, my father
has not been the same.</i>

11
00:01:44,016 --> 00:01:45,119
<i>Nor have I.</i>

12
00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:50,126
<i>His inaction is difficult
for me to accept.</i>

13
00:01:50,262 --> 00:01:53,358
<i>For, I know he loved Duke
Leto Atreides like a son.</i>

14
00:01:59,467 --> 00:02:01,439
<i>But my father's
always been guided</i>

15
00:02:01,575 --> 00:02:05,236
<i>by the calculus of power.</i>

16
00:02:05,372 --> 00:02:08,945
<i>This would not be the first time the
Harkonnens have done his dirty work.</i>

17
00:02:17,287 --> 00:02:20,022
In the shadows of
Arrakis lie many secrets...

18
00:02:22,292 --> 00:02:24,895
<i>but the darkest of
them all may remain.</i>

19
00:02:26,292 --> 00:02:28,228
<i>The end of House Atreides.</i>

20
00:02:44,079 --> 00:02:47,478
<i>Sister, Father is dead.</i>

21
00:02:48,747 --> 00:02:50,921
<i>Shouldn't you go
back to the stars,</i>

22
00:02:51,721 --> 00:02:52,791
<i>be with him?</i>

23
00:02:54,958 --> 00:02:58,522
<i>I'm afraid I won't have enough
time to fix things before your coming.</i>

24
00:03:00,898 --> 00:03:03,329
<i>This world is beyond cruelty.</i>

25
00:04:09,963 --> 00:04:11,500
Stay here.

26
00:09:00,591 --> 00:09:03,722
Never stand with your
back towards the open.

27
00:09:03,857 --> 00:09:05,645
How many times do I
have to tell you that?

28
00:09:05,725 --> 00:09:07,996
You okay?

29
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:10,564
- Yeah.
- How 'bout her?

30
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:13,600
She's fine.

31
00:09:19,775 --> 00:09:23,874
They do not
usually venture this deep.

32
00:09:24,009 --> 00:09:25,745
They wanna make sure
no Atreides escaped.

33
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:28,415
You
think too much of yourself.

34
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:31,185
No, no, we are
in the deep desert.

35
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:33,849
Only Fremen can survive here.

36
00:09:33,985 --> 00:09:36,419
They were here
for us, not for you.

37
00:09:36,555 --> 00:09:39,395
Don't worry.

38
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:42,495
I'm taking you somewhere
they will never find us.

39
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:01,750
Filthy water.

40
00:10:01,886 --> 00:10:06,356
It's full of chemicals, but good
enough for cooling systems.

41
00:10:10,192 --> 00:10:11,192
Don't let it out.

42
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:15,491
You okay?

43
00:10:15,627 --> 00:10:16,692
Don't let that out.

44
00:10:16,828 --> 00:10:18,861
Don't let it out!

45
00:10:23,475 --> 00:10:24,729
- I'm okay.
- Are you sure?

46
00:10:30,212 --> 00:10:31,546
You fought well...

47
00:10:32,412 --> 00:10:33,779
once you woke up.

48
00:10:35,052 --> 00:10:35,849
I wasn't sleeping.

49
00:11:07,351 --> 00:11:09,551
No, no, no. I'll do it.

50
00:12:13,414 --> 00:12:15,881
Lor... Lord Rabban.

51
00:12:16,017 --> 00:12:18,019
Now that the spice
fields have been secured,

52
00:12:18,155 --> 00:12:21,490
I strongly recommend bringing
all troops out of Fremen territories.

53
00:12:21,625 --> 00:12:23,387
We're losing too
many men to the desert.

54
00:12:23,523 --> 00:12:24,757
Rats.

55
00:12:26,599 --> 00:12:29,697
- I beg your pardon?
- We're losing men to rats.

56
00:12:32,602 --> 00:12:34,636
Fremen! I can't
confirm, my Lord.

57
00:12:34,772 --> 00:12:36,507
Communications are
hectic in the open sands.

58
00:12:36,642 --> 00:12:39,707
Your orders were to
control the whole planet.

59
00:12:41,512 --> 00:12:44,107
- We are.
- I see only half of it.

60
00:12:44,242 --> 00:12:45,701
As you may recall,

61
00:12:45,781 --> 00:12:48,716
the South is
uninhabitable, my Lord.

62
00:12:50,852 --> 00:12:52,619
May I suggest you get some rest?

63
00:12:52,755 --> 00:12:55,556
Rats! Hairy rats!

64
00:12:55,692 --> 00:12:58,092
Kill them! Kill
them! Kill them all!

65
00:12:58,228 --> 00:13:00,062
Kill them all!

66
00:13:00,197 --> 00:13:02,429
<i>Rats!</i>

67
00:13:48,776 --> 00:13:49,976
He's asking why we're so late.

68
00:13:55,847 --> 00:13:57,021
He thinks you're spies.

69
00:13:59,656 --> 00:14:01,855
He
said... - I got that.

70
00:14:01,991 --> 00:14:05,424
- Thanks.
- Stay close to me.

71
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:26,979
Sietch Tabr.

72
00:16:00,874 --> 00:16:02,272
<i>Lisan al-Gaib!</i>

73
00:17:02,008 --> 00:17:04,807
Look how your Bene Gesserit
propaganda has taken root.

74
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,779
Some of them already
think I'm their messiah.

75
00:17:11,513 --> 00:17:12,782
Others...

76
00:17:14,352 --> 00:17:15,352
false prophet.

77
00:17:16,786 --> 00:17:19,484
I must sway the non-believers.

78
00:17:19,619 --> 00:17:22,518
If they follow me, we can
disrupt spice production.

79
00:17:22,653 --> 00:17:24,893
That's the only way I
can get to the Emperor.

80
00:17:26,293 --> 00:17:28,094
Your father didn't
believe in revenge.

81
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:30,195
Yeah, well, I do.

82
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:04,834
What is happening?

83
00:18:13,707 --> 00:18:14,875
What is it?

84
00:18:15,011 --> 00:18:16,609
There is
spice in the food.

85
00:18:27,187 --> 00:18:28,858
Woman.

86
00:18:30,692 --> 00:18:32,290
Come with me.

87
00:19:42,198 --> 00:19:45,368
Thirty-eight
million decaliters.

88
00:19:45,503 --> 00:19:51,307
None of us, even dying of
thirst, would ever drink this water.

89
00:19:51,442 --> 00:19:52,469
This is...

90
00:19:53,806 --> 00:19:55,142
sacred.

91
00:19:59,077 --> 00:20:00,378
Jamis' water.

92
00:20:01,852 --> 00:20:05,251
We have a thousand such places.

93
00:20:06,152 --> 00:20:09,324
When we have enough water,

94
00:20:09,459 --> 00:20:13,756
the <i>Lisan al-Gaib</i> will
change the face of Arrakis.

95
00:20:13,891 --> 00:20:16,933
He will bring back the
trees. He will bring back...

96
00:20:18,734 --> 00:20:20,134
a Green Paradise.

97
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:24,670
So many souls.

98
00:20:34,913 --> 00:20:39,054
Never give your water away,
not even for the dead.

99
00:20:41,759 --> 00:20:43,054
Why are you showing me this?

100
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:44,794
Because you are Bene Gesserit.

101
00:20:44,930 --> 00:20:48,563
Because you understand
the prophecies.

102
00:20:48,698 --> 00:20:52,397
The mother of the <i>Lisan al-Gaib</i>
will be a Reverend Mother.

103
00:20:53,464 --> 00:20:56,203
Our Reverend Mother is dying.

104
00:20:57,636 --> 00:20:59,936
You want
me to take her place?

105
00:21:00,071 --> 00:21:03,144
Yes, I do.

106
00:21:05,617 --> 00:21:07,049
You believe in Paul?

107
00:21:09,718 --> 00:21:11,251
There are signs.

108
00:21:12,588 --> 00:21:14,087
Yes.

109
00:21:15,990 --> 00:21:17,388
What if I would refuse?

110
00:21:17,523 --> 00:21:20,324
Then, he's
not <i>Lisan al-Gaib,</i>

111
00:21:20,459 --> 00:21:22,399
and you have no
purpose to serve.

112
00:21:22,534 --> 00:21:26,601
What else is left to do then but
to return your water to the well?

113
00:21:31,810 --> 00:21:33,174
It's an honor, isn't it?

114
00:21:34,639 --> 00:21:36,177
I think you should feel honored.

115
00:21:36,313 --> 00:21:38,212
Well, it was a choice
between this or death,

116
00:21:38,347 --> 00:21:40,379
so, you know, forgive
me if I'm not flattered.

117
00:21:42,351 --> 00:21:43,954
How does one become
a Reverend Mother?

118
00:21:44,089 --> 00:21:45,953
It's different from
one culture to another.

119
00:21:46,089 --> 00:21:48,189
Here on Arrakis, I have no idea.

120
00:21:52,531 --> 00:21:54,395
You're afraid.

121
00:21:54,531 --> 00:21:56,385
Reverend Mothers are tasked
with holding the memories

122
00:21:56,465 --> 00:21:58,255
of all the Reverend Mothers
that came before them,

123
00:21:58,335 --> 00:22:01,697
so I'll be given centuries
of pain and sorrow.

124
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:03,540
Is it dangerous?

125
00:22:04,203 --> 00:22:06,042
It's lethal for men.

126
00:22:06,676 --> 00:22:08,171
That's for sure.

127
00:23:16,608 --> 00:23:18,647
What are you guys
laughing about?

128
00:23:18,783 --> 00:23:20,017
Don't bother.

129
00:23:24,989 --> 00:23:26,139
You don't believe in all this?

130
00:23:26,219 --> 00:23:27,552
No, we don't.

131
00:23:27,687 --> 00:23:29,658
These are
old Southern beliefs.

132
00:23:29,793 --> 00:23:31,561
Southern beliefs?

133
00:23:31,696 --> 00:23:35,098
Southern tribes believe a messiah
will come to deliver us from evil.

134
00:23:35,233 --> 00:23:37,195
You don't believe
in the <i>Lisan al-Gaib?</i>

135
00:23:37,331 --> 00:23:39,735
We believe in Fremen.

136
00:23:41,838 --> 00:23:44,833
You want to control people,
you tell them a messiah will come.

137
00:23:44,969 --> 00:23:48,811
Then they'll wait for centuries.

138
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:55,250
Now, we must pray.

139
00:24:02,726 --> 00:24:03,552
What about him?

140
00:24:03,687 --> 00:24:05,327
Stilgar?

141
00:24:05,463 --> 00:24:08,259
He's from the South. You
didn't notice his accent?

142
00:24:17,502 --> 00:24:18,774
What'll happen to my mother?

143
00:24:40,927 --> 00:24:43,662
I must not
fear. Fear is the mind-killer.

144
00:24:43,797 --> 00:24:46,869
Fear, the little death that
brings total obliteration.

145
00:24:47,005 --> 00:24:48,765
I will face my fear. I will...

146
00:25:15,898 --> 00:25:16,699
What is it?

147
00:25:16,835 --> 00:25:17,835
Drink!

148
00:27:28,330 --> 00:27:30,828
She's right. She's right!

149
00:27:33,002 --> 00:27:34,029
It's no miracle.

150
00:27:35,439 --> 00:27:38,005
My mother was
trained to do that.

151
00:27:38,141 --> 00:27:41,443
Poison transmutation is something
advanced Bene Gesserit can do.

152
00:27:44,708 --> 00:27:46,041
I'm not the <i>Mahdi.</i>

153
00:27:49,515 --> 00:27:50,914
I'm not here to lead.

154
00:27:56,923 --> 00:28:00,363
Let me fight beside
you. That's all I'm asking.

155
00:28:23,615 --> 00:28:24,750
How are you?

156
00:28:25,583 --> 00:28:26,785
Better.

157
00:28:27,684 --> 00:28:28,886
How is she?

158
00:28:30,121 --> 00:28:32,021
She was
frightened, but she's...

159
00:28:33,491 --> 00:28:34,694
she's okay.

160
00:28:40,698 --> 00:28:41,800
Paul.

161
00:28:45,041 --> 00:28:46,739
She talks to me.

162
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:51,474
She believes in you.

163
00:28:55,183 --> 00:28:56,452
She says...

164
00:29:03,622 --> 00:29:05,489
You're so close now.

165
00:29:05,625 --> 00:29:09,993
Only one step remains and you
will become the <i>Kwisatz Haderach.</i>

166
00:29:11,102 --> 00:29:12,864
Only one step remains.

167
00:29:13,632 --> 00:29:14,963
You must do what I did.

168
00:29:15,099 --> 00:29:18,302
You must drink
the Water of Life.

169
00:29:18,438 --> 00:29:22,511
And your mind, it's gon... it's
gonna open and you will see.

170
00:29:33,157 --> 00:29:38,093
If you wanna fight
with us, first thing, you must learn

171
00:29:38,229 --> 00:29:40,155
to be one with the desert.

172
00:29:41,597 --> 00:29:44,864
So, here is a tent
and enough food.

173
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:49,934
I want you to cross that
small erg and come back.

174
00:29:50,535 --> 00:29:51,967
Travel by night.

175
00:29:52,102 --> 00:29:53,668
You know how to
use a paracompass?

176
00:29:53,803 --> 00:29:54,972
Yes.

177
00:29:57,941 --> 00:29:59,416
Anything else I should know?

178
00:29:59,551 --> 00:30:01,811
Beside the worms
and the Harkonnens,

179
00:30:01,946 --> 00:30:05,587
beware of the trapdoor spiders.

180
00:30:05,723 --> 00:30:09,189
Centipedes are very
nasty. Not the big ones.

181
00:30:09,324 --> 00:30:10,892
They are harmless.

182
00:30:11,027 --> 00:30:14,860
But the little ones, you have
to worry about. And...

183
00:30:17,161 --> 00:30:20,998
Don't ever, ever
listen to the jinn.

184
00:30:23,274 --> 00:30:24,841
- The jinn?
- Jinn.

185
00:30:24,976 --> 00:30:26,641
Desert spirits.

186
00:30:27,871 --> 00:30:30,442
They whisper at night.

187
00:30:34,714 --> 00:30:37,420
They, they can possess you.

188
00:30:37,555 --> 00:30:41,788
Really, be careful.
They are demons.

189
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,826
But it's true. Don't
listen to them.

190
00:32:12,249 --> 00:32:13,781
Jamis.

191
00:32:15,984 --> 00:32:18,621
You sandwalk
like a drunk lizard.

192
00:32:21,659 --> 00:32:23,055
Yeah, I'm doing
pretty good so far.

193
00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:25,958
Yeah, well, you're not
even in worm territory yet.

194
00:32:44,782 --> 00:32:46,682
You have to
break up your rhythm.

195
00:32:50,583 --> 00:32:52,517
Like this.

196
00:32:52,653 --> 00:32:55,422
Now, that's interesting
because in the filmbooks I've studied,

197
00:32:55,558 --> 00:32:59,222
the anthropologists say, in order to
properly sandwalk, you actually have...

198
00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:05,162
Never mind. Please keep going.

199
00:33:33,091 --> 00:33:36,524
You know, I'm the only one who believes
you're gonna make it until summer?

200
00:33:36,659 --> 00:33:38,833
Everyone else thinks you
won't make it two weeks.

201
00:33:40,001 --> 00:33:41,252
If you wanna follow
us in the desert,

202
00:33:41,332 --> 00:33:42,831
you need to know
how windtraps work.

203
00:33:42,966 --> 00:33:44,500
So, listen to me.

204
00:33:44,636 --> 00:33:46,973
They're simple, but they
require constant attention.

205
00:33:47,108 --> 00:33:50,273
This right here, it
captures the moisture

206
00:33:50,408 --> 00:33:52,242
and then it carries
it into that pocket.

207
00:33:53,144 --> 00:33:56,113
And these are the filters.

208
00:33:56,249 --> 00:33:58,116
They need to be
changed every three days.

209
00:33:59,816 --> 00:34:00,888
What?

210
00:34:05,530 --> 00:34:07,224
Stop looking at me like that.

211
00:34:12,364 --> 00:34:13,998
He's training
with the Fremen.

212
00:34:14,134 --> 00:34:16,299
He will be back
soon. Don't worry.

213
00:34:19,503 --> 00:34:23,043
You're right. If we want
to protect your brother,

214
00:34:23,178 --> 00:34:26,382
we need all the Fremen
to believe in the prophecy.

215
00:34:30,648 --> 00:34:35,318
<i>We must convert the
non-believers one by one.</i>

216
00:34:37,258 --> 00:34:39,993
<i>We need to start
with the weaker ones.</i>

217
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,897
<i>The vulnerable ones.</i>

218
00:34:44,469 --> 00:34:47,000
<i>The ones who fear us.</i>

219
00:35:09,688 --> 00:35:12,487
Hey, get out of here. Go.

220
00:36:54,997 --> 00:36:56,932
- You okay?
- Yeah.

221
00:37:34,165 --> 00:37:35,403
Let's go! Move!

222
00:37:52,853 --> 00:37:54,286
Load.

223
00:38:14,105 --> 00:38:15,505
Chani!

224
00:38:20,550 --> 00:38:21,550
Reload!

225
00:38:35,996 --> 00:38:37,599
Reload.

226
00:38:37,734 --> 00:38:38,734
Watch out!

227
00:38:55,350 --> 00:38:57,419
Its shield will
only open when it fires.

228
00:38:57,554 --> 00:38:59,175
I know that. What
do you think I'm trying to do?

229
00:38:59,255 --> 00:39:02,453
I'll trigger it. On
my signal. Be ready.

230
00:39:25,043 --> 00:39:26,543
Go!

231
00:39:28,113 --> 00:39:29,913
Shit!

232
00:39:32,482 --> 00:39:34,456
Go! Go!

233
00:40:40,387 --> 00:40:42,119
Who taught you
to fight like that?

234
00:40:42,255 --> 00:40:43,922
My old masters.

235
00:40:44,058 --> 00:40:45,523
They were close friends.

236
00:40:48,430 --> 00:40:51,760
They were massacred.
Alongside my father.

237
00:40:56,934 --> 00:41:00,208
You've been fighting the
Harkonnens for decades.

238
00:41:00,344 --> 00:41:02,611
My family's been
fighting them for centuries.

239
00:41:02,747 --> 00:41:07,610
I know everything about them.
Their habits, their ways of thinking.

240
00:41:07,746 --> 00:41:09,172
You know everything
about the desert.

241
00:41:09,252 --> 00:41:12,413
You harness the
very power of it.

242
00:41:12,548 --> 00:41:17,588
We can stop them together, bury
them in the sand where they belong.

243
00:41:17,723 --> 00:41:19,887
So that this planet can
be yours once more.

244
00:41:20,023 --> 00:41:23,898
What
would you have us do?

245
00:41:24,033 --> 00:41:25,666
What would you do, Stilgar?

246
00:41:25,801 --> 00:41:29,937
I? I would... would
strike even further north.

247
00:41:30,073 --> 00:41:31,671
Then I will go further north.

248
00:41:31,807 --> 00:41:34,742
And the further north you
go, the more likely it is you die.

249
00:41:58,532 --> 00:42:01,736
I see strength in you.

250
00:42:07,271 --> 00:42:08,610
Come, come.

251
00:42:18,619 --> 00:42:24,222
You shall be know
among us as <i>Usul.</i>

252
00:42:24,358 --> 00:42:25,823
- <i>Usul.
- Usul.</i>

253
00:42:25,958 --> 00:42:30,095
<i>Usul.</i> And now,
a Fedaykin is a fighter

254
00:42:30,230 --> 00:42:31,629
and needs a war name.

255
00:42:32,395 --> 00:42:33,895
You must choose.

256
00:42:38,569 --> 00:42:40,242
How do you call the...

257
00:42:41,474 --> 00:42:43,106
The small desert mouse, again?

258
00:42:44,644 --> 00:42:46,243
<i>- Muad'Dib?</i>
<i>- Muad'Dib.</i>

259
00:42:46,378 --> 00:42:48,713
No, no, no.

260
00:42:48,849 --> 00:42:52,820
<i>Muad'Dib</i> is wise in
the ways of the desert.

261
00:42:52,955 --> 00:42:54,355
<i>Muad'Dib...</i>

262
00:42:55,191 --> 00:42:57,320
creates his own water.

263
00:42:57,456 --> 00:43:01,424
The constellation that points to
the North Star, we call <i>Muad'Dib.</i>

264
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:03,562
"The One Who Points the Way."

265
00:43:05,232 --> 00:43:06,664
That is a powerful name.

266
00:43:11,405 --> 00:43:15,371
Now you are our brother.

267
00:43:15,506 --> 00:43:18,841
Paul <i>Muad'Dib Usul.</i>

268
00:43:25,187 --> 00:43:26,486
<i>Muad'Dib Usul.</i>

269
00:43:27,121 --> 00:43:28,389
<i>Muad'Dib Usul.</i>

270
00:43:30,190 --> 00:43:31,353
<i>Muad'Dib Usul.</i>

271
00:43:33,756 --> 00:43:36,463
<i>Muad'Dib Usul.</i>.

272
00:43:37,197 --> 00:43:38,300
<i>Muad'Dib.</i>

273
00:43:41,333 --> 00:43:42,469
<i>Usul.</i>

274
00:44:00,056 --> 00:44:02,355
Hey! Stilgar!

275
00:44:17,337 --> 00:44:18,840
Father, I found my way.

276
00:44:36,126 --> 00:44:37,293
It's breathtaking.

277
00:44:48,666 --> 00:44:52,671
Look. Right there. Spice.

278
00:44:52,806 --> 00:44:55,839
Arrakis is so beautiful
when the sun is low.

279
00:45:03,116 --> 00:45:07,921
Where you're from, does
water really fall from the sky?

280
00:45:08,056 --> 00:45:09,853
Yes.

281
00:45:09,988 --> 00:45:13,261
Sometimes it rains
for weeks on Caladan.

282
00:45:13,397 --> 00:45:15,859
Where you see sand
here, imagine water.

283
00:45:18,833 --> 00:45:22,833
Our castle stands on
cliffs high above the sea.

284
00:45:22,968 --> 00:45:25,804
If you dive in, you
can't reach the bottom.

285
00:45:25,940 --> 00:45:29,808
- You dive in?
- Yes, it's called swimming.

286
00:45:29,943 --> 00:45:32,847
I don't... I
don't believe you, <i>Usul.</i>

287
00:45:32,982 --> 00:45:34,042
<i>Usul.</i>

288
00:45:36,548 --> 00:45:37,980
What's your secret name?

289
00:45:40,220 --> 00:45:41,748
<i>Sihaya.</i>

290
00:45:41,884 --> 00:45:43,458
<i>Sihaya.</i>

291
00:45:44,721 --> 00:45:46,356
What does that mean?

292
00:45:46,492 --> 00:45:48,225
Means Desert Spring.

293
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:49,629
"Desert Spring."

294
00:45:51,367 --> 00:45:53,028
- I love it.
- I hate it.

295
00:45:53,996 --> 00:45:56,064
It's from some stupid prophecy.

296
00:45:57,105 --> 00:45:58,132
I prefer Chani.

297
00:45:59,209 --> 00:46:00,739
I prefer Chani, too, then.

298
00:46:07,649 --> 00:46:09,482
Do you think Stilgar
would teach me?

299
00:46:09,618 --> 00:46:11,012
- To ride?
- Yeah.

300
00:46:11,148 --> 00:46:14,488
No.
Only Fremen ride worms.

301
00:46:14,624 --> 00:46:16,288
Well, I thought I'd
become one, didn't I?

302
00:46:16,423 --> 00:46:18,493
By name, not by blood.

303
00:46:20,630 --> 00:46:25,533
Your blood comes from
Dukes and Great Houses.

304
00:46:27,368 --> 00:46:29,569
We don't have that here.

305
00:46:29,705 --> 00:46:33,607
Here, we're equal,
men and women alike.

306
00:46:33,742 --> 00:46:35,807
What we do, we do
for the benefit of all.

307
00:46:35,942 --> 00:46:38,513
Well, I'd very much
like to be equal to you.

308
00:46:44,551 --> 00:46:47,984
Paul <i>Muad'Dib Usul...</i>

309
00:46:49,688 --> 00:46:52,054
maybe you could be Fremen.

310
00:46:55,265 --> 00:46:56,663
Maybe I'll show you the way.

311
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:26,715
Rabban.

312
00:48:37,493 --> 00:48:41,762
Fremen
attacks on your watch.

313
00:48:41,897 --> 00:48:47,971
Your orders were to restore
spice production to full capacity.

314
00:48:48,107 --> 00:48:50,744
Do you know what
it means if you fail?

315
00:48:52,145 --> 00:48:56,244
The Emperor will take
spice out of our control.

316
00:48:57,079 --> 00:48:58,585
Tighten your grip, Rabban.

317
00:48:58,721 --> 00:49:00,655
Uncle.

318
00:49:00,791 --> 00:49:03,284
Or
feel mine on your neck.

319
00:49:18,808 --> 00:49:20,835
<i>Usul? Usul.</i>

320
00:49:20,970 --> 00:49:23,975
It's okay. It's okay.

321
00:49:27,281 --> 00:49:28,281
Hey.

322
00:49:30,881 --> 00:49:33,889
I'm here, I'm here.

323
00:49:34,024 --> 00:49:37,188
It's been a while since you've
had one of those nightmares.

324
00:49:41,961 --> 00:49:44,292
Tell me,
what was it about?

325
00:49:50,169 --> 00:49:53,371
<i>Nothing's clear.
It's only fragments.</i>

326
00:49:55,308 --> 00:49:59,648
<i>I'm in the South, and
I'm following someone.</i>

327
00:50:00,814 --> 00:50:02,948
<i>And it triggers a holy war.</i>

328
00:50:06,221 --> 00:50:10,120
<i>Millions and millions of
people starving to death...</i>

329
00:50:11,459 --> 00:50:12,826
<i>because of me.</i>

330
00:50:18,332 --> 00:50:21,567
You've been exposed
to spice for a long time.

331
00:50:21,702 --> 00:50:23,666
It can create weird dreams.

332
00:50:30,807 --> 00:50:31,878
It's a big day.

333
00:50:33,848 --> 00:50:35,380
We can ask
Stilgar to call it off.

334
00:50:35,516 --> 00:50:38,181
No. I'm fine.

335
00:50:54,029 --> 00:50:55,165
<i>Usul.</i>

336
00:50:57,802 --> 00:50:59,939
I tuned it myself.

337
00:51:01,873 --> 00:51:03,305
- Here.
- Thanks.

338
00:51:05,810 --> 00:51:09,949
Don't try to impress anyone.
You are brave. We all know that.

339
00:51:10,715 --> 00:51:12,980
Heh? Be simple.

340
00:51:13,116 --> 00:51:16,217
Be direct. Nothing fancy.

341
00:51:16,352 --> 00:51:18,386
- Nothing fancy.
- Hey, I'm serious.

342
00:51:18,521 --> 00:51:21,090
Nothing fancy or you
will shame my teaching.

343
00:51:21,226 --> 00:51:24,958
I won't shame you. I understand.

344
00:51:25,094 --> 00:51:30,134
<i>Shai-Hulud</i> decides today if
you become Fremen, or if you die.

345
00:51:37,974 --> 00:51:38,974
Hey, <i>Muad'Dib!</i>

346
00:52:20,918 --> 00:52:22,120
Lower.

347
00:52:46,448 --> 00:52:48,850
Okay. Okay.

348
00:54:00,523 --> 00:54:05,058
Okay. Okay. Okay.

349
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:53,667
Okay.

350
00:55:11,087 --> 00:55:12,523
Okay. Okay!

351
00:55:37,519 --> 00:55:38,547
Come on!

352
00:55:49,498 --> 00:55:50,498
Whoa!

353
00:56:53,827 --> 00:56:55,129
You're a rider!

354
00:58:50,478 --> 00:58:53,214
I know they do.

355
00:58:55,747 --> 00:58:58,313
<i>Our task in the
North is nearly done.</i>

356
00:58:58,449 --> 00:59:00,386
<i>They believe in Paul.</i>

357
00:59:01,220 --> 00:59:03,358
<i>Now we go South.</i>

358
00:59:03,493 --> 00:59:06,854
<i>There are millions of
fundamentalists there.</i>

359
00:59:06,989 --> 00:59:09,725
<i>They will protect
him when he comes.</i>

360
00:59:11,997 --> 00:59:16,567
<i>The</i> Kwisatz Haderach
<i>will be born in the South.</i>

361
00:59:30,381 --> 00:59:32,352
As long as I breathe.

362
00:59:36,793 --> 00:59:37,793
What's wrong?

363
00:59:43,831 --> 00:59:44,491
Chani.

364
00:59:44,626 --> 00:59:46,399
There will be trouble.

365
00:59:48,367 --> 00:59:49,831
What are you talking about?

366
00:59:53,470 --> 00:59:54,974
Chani, what do you mean?

367
00:59:55,110 --> 00:59:56,640
The way they look at you.

368
00:59:58,013 --> 00:59:59,478
They worship you now.

369
01:00:01,978 --> 01:00:04,547
The Fedaykin, they
count your victories.

370
01:00:04,683 --> 01:00:07,185
They say you can see the future.

371
01:00:07,321 --> 01:00:09,290
Whisper, " <i>Lisan al-Gaib."</i>

372
01:00:10,353 --> 01:00:11,886
I'm no messiah.

373
01:00:14,460 --> 01:00:17,528
I'm a Fedaykin of Sietch Tabr.

374
01:00:17,664 --> 01:00:20,266
Yet, we have a Bene
Gesserit among us,

375
01:00:20,401 --> 01:00:21,836
fanning the flames
of your legend,

376
01:00:21,971 --> 01:00:23,502
saying you're the One.

377
01:00:50,730 --> 01:00:52,762
She says you should
be coming with us.

378
01:00:53,463 --> 01:00:54,698
You know I can't.

379
01:00:55,399 --> 01:00:56,732
She's asking why.

380
01:00:56,868 --> 01:00:58,735
Because I must continue
fighting in the North,

381
01:00:58,870 --> 01:01:01,276
to protect you down
there in the South.

382
01:01:02,840 --> 01:01:06,175
She says she can
tell when you lie.

383
01:01:06,311 --> 01:01:10,010
Tell her that's because our mother
keeps spreading dangerous tales.

384
01:01:17,422 --> 01:01:19,126
What is she saying now?

385
01:01:19,262 --> 01:01:21,561
She says you're blinded by love,

386
01:01:21,696 --> 01:01:23,758
and she reminds you that
you must reserve your hand

387
01:01:23,894 --> 01:01:25,927
for the most strategic alliance.

388
01:01:28,563 --> 01:01:31,838
She's also wondering why
you don't believe in who you are.

389
01:01:31,974 --> 01:01:32,866
I do believe.

390
01:01:33,001 --> 01:01:35,310
I believe I matter
to these people.

391
01:01:36,712 --> 01:01:38,907
And I believe I'm making
a difference in this war.

392
01:01:40,747 --> 01:01:42,227
We're nearly at
the gates of the city.

393
01:01:42,310 --> 01:01:45,080
- That's not what she means.
- I know what she means.

394
01:01:45,216 --> 01:01:47,855
Do you not think I also feel
the weight of the prophecy?

395
01:01:47,991 --> 01:01:49,653
It's not a prophecy.

396
01:01:49,788 --> 01:01:51,391
It's a story that
you keep telling,

397
01:01:51,527 --> 01:01:53,460
but it's not their
story, it's yours.

398
01:01:53,595 --> 01:01:56,695
They deserve to be
led by one of their own.

399
01:01:56,830 --> 01:01:59,431
What your people did to
this world is heartbreaking.

400
01:01:59,567 --> 01:02:01,133
We gave them
something to hope for.

401
01:02:01,269 --> 01:02:02,964
That's not hope!

402
01:02:17,152 --> 01:02:18,650
I'll be waiting for you.

403
01:02:19,881 --> 01:02:21,255
All of us.

404
01:02:21,391 --> 01:02:23,222
<i>All of us.</i>

405
01:03:04,698 --> 01:03:07,231
Those storms look bad.

406
01:03:54,213 --> 01:03:55,998
- How much?
- We lost...

407
01:03:56,078 --> 01:03:58,445
eighty percent of our last crop.

408
01:03:58,581 --> 01:04:02,348
My Lord Rabban, you should
not leave the security perimeter.

409
01:04:02,483 --> 01:04:04,986
Security perimeter? The
rats are already inside.

410
01:04:05,121 --> 01:04:07,060
The Fremen Demon
might be with them.

411
01:04:07,196 --> 01:04:08,629
I hope so.

412
01:04:08,765 --> 01:04:10,483
We're
tracking them, my Lord.

413
01:04:10,563 --> 01:04:13,567
Today, <i>Muad'Dib</i> dies!

414
01:04:55,143 --> 01:04:56,505
Where is he?

415
01:04:56,641 --> 01:04:58,008
Still negative, my Lord.

416
01:04:58,143 --> 01:04:59,983
Why do I have
to do everything myself?

417
01:05:02,810 --> 01:05:03,812
Open range!

418
01:05:03,947 --> 01:05:05,619
Range open.

419
01:05:13,395 --> 01:05:15,123
Life. Delta, delta, delta.

420
01:05:36,382 --> 01:05:37,651
I've lost them.

421
01:05:42,891 --> 01:05:44,889
- Strike!
- Yes, my Lord.

422
01:06:51,459 --> 01:06:54,194
<i>Muad'Dib!</i>

423
01:06:54,330 --> 01:06:56,191
Show yourself!

424
01:07:26,657 --> 01:07:31,127
<i>Muad'Dib! Muad'Dib! Muad'Dib!</i>

425
01:08:23,986 --> 01:08:26,219
For <i>Muad'Dib!</i>

426
01:08:38,765 --> 01:08:39,998
<i>Muad'Dib.</i>

427
01:08:42,163 --> 01:08:45,869
Some new Fremen prophet?

428
01:08:46,004 --> 01:08:49,057
It's not the first time
we've had frictions with the Fremen.

429
01:08:49,137 --> 01:08:51,141
None of this magnitude.

430
01:08:55,143 --> 01:08:56,949
So, my dear daughter...

431
01:08:58,018 --> 01:09:00,414
how would you deal
with this prophet?

432
01:09:06,423 --> 01:09:09,489
If this <i>Muad'Dib</i>
is a religious figure,

433
01:09:11,028 --> 01:09:12,998
you can't use direct force.

434
01:09:14,299 --> 01:09:17,431
Repression only
makes a religion flourish.

435
01:09:17,566 --> 01:09:19,738
You'll only end up
humiliating yourself.

436
01:09:19,873 --> 01:09:21,302
You underestimate my Sardaukar.

437
01:09:21,438 --> 01:09:24,504
You underestimate
the power of faith.

438
01:09:28,010 --> 01:09:31,984
Her Highness proves once again
that she was my most acute student.

439
01:09:34,056 --> 01:09:36,822
- You'd send assassins?
- No.

440
01:09:36,958 --> 01:09:38,925
Prophets get
stronger when they die.

441
01:09:40,391 --> 01:09:42,894
Let the conflict on
Arrakis turn into war.

442
01:09:43,030 --> 01:09:46,394
You then bring
peace. As a savior.

443
01:09:48,737 --> 01:09:50,871
You'd be a formidable empress.

444
01:09:55,006 --> 01:09:57,841
<i>Muad'Dib.</i> The prophet.

445
01:09:57,976 --> 01:10:00,345
The one who points the way.

446
01:10:00,480 --> 01:10:02,745
These are our own
religious patterns, aren't they?

447
01:10:02,880 --> 01:10:04,346
This is our doing.

448
01:10:07,822 --> 01:10:10,757
<i>Muad'Dib</i> means kangaroo mouse.

449
01:10:10,893 --> 01:10:12,992
An unusual war
name for a Fremen.

450
01:10:14,793 --> 01:10:17,793
- What if Paul Atreides were still alive?
- Enough!

451
01:10:17,928 --> 01:10:22,463
This must not come out. Even
to your father's ears. Understand?

452
01:10:23,231 --> 01:10:25,834
I do, Reverend Mother.

453
01:10:25,970 --> 01:10:29,303
If Paul
is alive, he likely knows the truth.

454
01:10:29,439 --> 01:10:31,311
And should the
Great Houses learn

455
01:10:31,446 --> 01:10:34,443
that your father was behind
the liquidation of the Atreides,

456
01:10:34,578 --> 01:10:38,314
your father will face
war and lose the throne.

457
01:10:40,083 --> 01:10:41,614
Then what hope is there?

458
01:10:42,951 --> 01:10:44,023
Hope?

459
01:10:45,291 --> 01:10:49,622
We are Bene Gesserit.
We don't hope, we plan.

460
01:10:50,799 --> 01:10:54,260
Paul is not our only prospect.

461
01:10:54,395 --> 01:11:00,006
The Baron's youngest nephew, Feyd-Rautha
Harkonnen, will inherit Arrakis.

462
01:11:01,335 --> 01:11:02,774
He may be the answer.

463
01:11:02,909 --> 01:11:05,544
Feyd-Rautha? He's psychotic.

464
01:11:05,679 --> 01:11:07,309
That's irrelevant.

465
01:11:07,444 --> 01:11:11,683
The question is,
can we control him?

466
01:11:11,819 --> 01:11:13,415
And I intend to find out.

467
01:11:36,544 --> 01:11:39,276
Would you like
some fresh meat, my darlings?

468
01:11:40,146 --> 01:11:42,977
Lungs? Or liver?

469
01:11:43,112 --> 01:11:46,282
What would
you like? I hear they're big today.

470
01:11:46,418 --> 01:11:50,788
Your new blades for
this very special day,

471
01:11:50,923 --> 01:11:53,961
na-Baron, Feyd-Rautha.

472
01:12:22,919 --> 01:12:24,108
A notch off balance.

473
01:12:24,188 --> 01:12:25,268
It's the tip.

474
01:12:25,957 --> 01:12:27,286
Should be sharper.

475
01:12:41,809 --> 01:12:43,107
Come.

476
01:12:43,242 --> 01:12:45,379
I won't
die like a fool.

477
01:12:45,514 --> 01:12:46,440
Kill me now.

478
01:12:46,576 --> 01:12:49,445
No drug for you today, Atreides.

479
01:14:04,592 --> 01:14:06,576
Welcome to Giedi Prime, sisters.

480
01:14:06,656 --> 01:14:08,661
I hope your travels
were agreeable.

481
01:14:08,797 --> 01:14:11,149
A long way
to come just to watch our prospect

482
01:14:11,229 --> 01:14:13,063
risk his life, Lady Fenring.

483
01:14:13,199 --> 01:14:15,131
No fear.

484
01:14:15,267 --> 01:14:17,170
These fights are all for show.

485
01:14:18,437 --> 01:14:20,735
But we'll get a
good look at him.

486
01:14:42,891 --> 01:14:47,200
Feyd-Rautha! Feyd-Rautha!

487
01:16:01,372 --> 01:16:02,539
That slave isn't drugged.

488
01:16:03,441 --> 01:16:05,377
That bug is walking straight.

489
01:16:06,443 --> 01:16:07,608
You should cancel the fight.

490
01:16:07,744 --> 01:16:10,442
Don't spoil my
nephew's birthday.

491
01:16:58,165 --> 01:17:00,964
Happy birthday, dear nephew.

492
01:17:17,278 --> 01:17:19,402
Why do they not stop the fight?

493
01:17:19,482 --> 01:17:21,251
Plans within plans.

494
01:17:26,159 --> 01:17:27,756
Show me who you are.

495
01:17:44,538 --> 01:17:46,313
There he is.

496
01:18:30,892 --> 01:18:32,689
Back! Back!

497
01:18:50,340 --> 01:18:51,471
Stay back!

498
01:19:05,153 --> 01:19:07,790
You have
fought well, Atreides.

499
01:19:19,167 --> 01:19:23,905
Feyd-Rautha! Feyd-Rautha!

500
01:19:29,348 --> 01:19:30,648
He's impressive, indeed.

501
01:19:30,783 --> 01:19:34,817
Feyd-Rautha! Feyd-Rautha!

502
01:19:42,597 --> 01:19:44,431
The
slave wasn't drugged.

503
01:19:46,596 --> 01:19:48,928
You tried to kill me.

504
01:19:49,064 --> 01:19:51,531
This morning you were a playboy,

505
01:19:51,666 --> 01:19:53,468
feared and envied,

506
01:19:53,604 --> 01:19:57,008
but tonight you're a hero.

507
01:19:57,143 --> 01:19:58,575
My gift to you.

508
01:19:58,711 --> 01:20:00,606
I ought to drown
you in that tub.

509
01:20:02,280 --> 01:20:04,381
Don't be hasty.

510
01:20:04,516 --> 01:20:07,051
I have another gift for you.

511
01:20:07,187 --> 01:20:08,554
A bigger one.

512
01:20:10,056 --> 01:20:11,519
Arrakis.

513
01:20:15,393 --> 01:20:16,960
What about Rabban?

514
01:20:17,096 --> 01:20:19,461
He has
failed to protect spice production.

515
01:20:19,597 --> 01:20:21,963
Rabban will be reassigned.

516
01:20:25,734 --> 01:20:28,539
Tame Arrakis, Feyd.

517
01:20:28,675 --> 01:20:31,478
Free the spice. I'll
make you Emperor.

518
01:20:43,587 --> 01:20:45,624
Emperor?

519
01:20:48,622 --> 01:20:49,793
How?

520
01:20:51,733 --> 01:20:54,864
The Emperor helped
me destroy the Atreides.

521
01:20:55,999 --> 01:20:58,872
He lent his own
army to the cause.

522
01:20:59,007 --> 01:21:01,040
A serious crime.

523
01:21:01,175 --> 01:21:05,776
If it came to light, the Great
Houses would rise against him.

524
01:21:06,410 --> 01:21:07,811
And then...

525
01:21:08,877 --> 01:21:11,518
who will sit on the throne?

526
01:21:12,286 --> 01:21:15,522
Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen.

527
01:21:55,560 --> 01:21:56,893
You're following me.

528
01:21:58,263 --> 01:21:59,291
Am I?

529
01:22:01,269 --> 01:22:02,800
I may have gotten lost.

530
01:22:04,567 --> 01:22:09,675
Will you show me the way out
of this maze, my Lord na-Baron?

531
01:22:16,713 --> 01:22:19,080
We've met, haven't we?

532
01:22:22,355 --> 01:22:23,656
I don't think so.

533
01:22:24,424 --> 01:22:26,724
I'm Lady Margot Fenring.

534
01:22:26,860 --> 01:22:29,055
I'm here to honor
your coming of age.

535
01:22:29,190 --> 01:22:31,158
You're not allowed
in this section.

536
01:22:32,094 --> 01:22:33,593
How did you get past the guards?

537
01:22:33,728 --> 01:22:35,129
The guards?

538
01:22:37,904 --> 01:22:40,002
May I ask,
what are you doing here?

539
01:22:42,074 --> 01:22:45,711
You're not taking part
in your own celebrations?

540
01:22:55,855 --> 01:22:58,385
You're Bene Gesserit.

541
01:22:58,521 --> 01:23:01,492
And
what makes you say that?

542
01:23:01,628 --> 01:23:03,990
I remember now.

543
01:23:04,125 --> 01:23:06,527
I dreamed about you last night.

544
01:23:06,662 --> 01:23:08,315
<i>A pleasant dream, I hope.</i>

545
01:23:08,395 --> 01:23:09,999
Don't
mock me, woman.

546
01:23:10,134 --> 01:23:11,671
<i>I wouldn't dare.</i>

547
01:23:13,807 --> 01:23:16,709
I know your Bene
Gesserit tricks.

548
01:23:16,844 --> 01:23:19,305
And what do you know
about the Bene Gesserit?

549
01:23:23,216 --> 01:23:24,216
Tell me.

550
01:23:28,321 --> 01:23:29,447
Something wrong?

551
01:23:29,583 --> 01:23:31,263
I don't
recognize this place.

552
01:23:32,459 --> 01:23:33,821
This is the guest wing.

553
01:23:36,797 --> 01:23:38,117
Where are you going?

554
01:23:39,794 --> 01:23:40,964
To my room.

555
01:24:07,995 --> 01:24:13,667
Come. To. Me.

556
01:24:16,764 --> 01:24:18,067
Kneel.

557
01:24:31,813 --> 01:24:35,084
Put your right hand in the box.

558
01:24:49,897 --> 01:24:53,436
A
sociopath. Of high intelligence.

559
01:24:53,572 --> 01:24:55,267
Driven. Cruel.

560
01:24:55,403 --> 01:24:57,876
But strongly motivated by honor.

561
01:24:58,809 --> 01:25:00,839
He yearns to be hurt.

562
01:25:00,975 --> 01:25:02,815
He loves pain.

563
01:25:02,950 --> 01:25:04,334
Can he be redeemed?

564
01:25:04,414 --> 01:25:06,001
He can be controlled.

565
01:25:06,081 --> 01:25:08,051
He's sexually vulnerable.

566
01:25:10,224 --> 01:25:11,224
And?

567
01:25:12,560 --> 01:25:14,222
The bloodline is secured.

568
01:25:15,794 --> 01:25:18,831
Female, as you requested.

569
01:25:19,665 --> 01:25:21,901
You did well, Margot.

570
01:25:22,036 --> 01:25:25,431
Respectfully, why didn't
you test him yourself?

571
01:25:26,705 --> 01:25:29,041
I'm a motherly figure.

572
01:25:29,177 --> 01:25:32,677
And based on what happened
between him and his own mother,

573
01:25:32,813 --> 01:25:35,243
I didn't expect to be effective.

574
01:25:35,378 --> 01:25:37,179
What happened between
him and his mother?

575
01:25:37,780 --> 01:25:38,851
He murdered her.

576
01:25:40,081 --> 01:25:43,251
Desire and humiliation.

577
01:25:44,525 --> 01:25:46,824
Those are his levers.

578
01:25:46,960 --> 01:25:49,222
If Feyd-Rautha
prevails on Arrakis,

579
01:25:49,358 --> 01:25:52,260
we shall know
how to control him.

580
01:26:12,950 --> 01:26:15,353
Rid me of this Fremen Demon.

581
01:26:30,301 --> 01:26:33,802
Feyd-Rautha! Feyd-Rautha!

582
01:26:33,938 --> 01:26:38,343
Feyd-Rautha! Feyd-Rautha!

583
01:26:38,478 --> 01:26:40,110
Feyd-Rautha!

584
01:27:00,527 --> 01:27:02,797
<i>♪ Do away with these idiots ♪</i>

585
01:27:02,933 --> 01:27:05,498

586
01:27:05,634 --> 01:27:09,876

590
01:27:23,249 --> 01:27:24,352
We're in.

591
01:27:28,022 --> 01:27:29,154
Juicy?

592
01:27:29,289 --> 01:27:31,022
Juicy, juicy.

593
01:27:33,628 --> 01:27:35,533
Well, it
was nice knowing ya.

594
01:27:35,668 --> 01:27:36,866
Yeah?

595
01:27:37,001 --> 01:27:38,938
Radar's clear. We're clear.

596
01:27:40,135 --> 01:27:41,875
Cooking time.

597
01:28:01,661 --> 01:28:03,129
Juicy, juicy.

598
01:28:03,264 --> 01:28:05,013
Yeah, I got a meter reading...

599
01:28:05,093 --> 01:28:07,014
All
right, guys, worms are on their way.

600
01:28:07,094 --> 01:28:08,315
- Watch out for abrasions.
- Get ready to dock.

601
01:28:08,395 --> 01:28:09,969
It's gonna get hot.

602
01:28:13,909 --> 01:28:15,741
Crank 'em
up! Throw them up!

603
01:28:44,770 --> 01:28:45,770
Hold!

604
01:29:00,048 --> 01:29:01,520
Mine! Mine!

605
01:29:01,656 --> 01:29:03,083
Get moving!

606
01:29:07,227 --> 01:29:09,655
- East! East!
- Get clear!

607
01:29:16,101 --> 01:29:17,932
Let's get out of here!

608
01:29:18,067 --> 01:29:19,632
Incoming!

609
01:29:22,876 --> 01:29:24,703
Don't run, fight!

610
01:29:26,311 --> 01:29:28,476
We're in
deep Fremen shit.

611
01:29:30,551 --> 01:29:31,749
Holy Mother.

612
01:29:43,026 --> 01:29:44,058
Fuck.

613
01:30:01,149 --> 01:30:03,883
I recognized
your footsteps...

614
01:30:04,019 --> 01:30:05,682
- old man.
- No.

615
01:30:29,977 --> 01:30:32,276
You young pup.

616
01:30:32,845 --> 01:30:34,405
You young pup!

617
01:30:41,586 --> 01:30:44,016
After
the Battle of Arrakeen,

618
01:30:44,151 --> 01:30:48,061
I was able to negotiate a trip
back home for the survivors.

619
01:30:49,093 --> 01:30:51,026
Thanks to these guys.

620
01:30:51,161 --> 01:30:52,560
Why'd you stay?

621
01:30:53,394 --> 01:30:55,068
Well, I wanted blood.

622
01:30:57,068 --> 01:30:58,368
Rabban's head?

623
01:31:01,101 --> 01:31:04,309
Well, since <i>Muad'Dib's</i>
been driving Rabban crazy,

624
01:31:04,444 --> 01:31:09,210
the smuggling business
has been quite profitable.

625
01:31:09,345 --> 01:31:11,348
Gurney Halleck the smuggler.

626
01:31:13,314 --> 01:31:15,549
Paul <i>Muad'Dib.</i>

627
01:31:15,684 --> 01:31:18,586
I've heard many
stories about <i>Muad'Dib.</i>

628
01:31:19,486 --> 01:31:21,259
None of them pretty.

629
01:31:22,292 --> 01:31:23,789
You see the fear?

630
01:31:25,397 --> 01:31:27,430
When our
resources are limited...

631
01:31:30,035 --> 01:31:31,731
fear is all we have.

632
01:31:49,252 --> 01:31:50,615
How many men with you?

633
01:31:50,751 --> 01:31:52,855
- Two hundred.
- Two hundred?

634
01:31:57,531 --> 01:32:00,661
Do you realize what you're
able to achieve with 200 men?

635
01:32:01,968 --> 01:32:03,400
Incredible fighters.

636
01:32:03,535 --> 01:32:05,023
Duncan said there
were millions of them.

637
01:32:05,103 --> 01:32:06,598
In the Deep South, yes.

638
01:32:06,733 --> 01:32:08,873
Well, what are you waiting for?

639
01:32:09,009 --> 01:32:12,311
With thousands of these guys, you
could take control of the entire planet.

640
01:32:12,446 --> 01:32:14,373
It's your father's dream.
What are you afraid of?

641
01:32:14,508 --> 01:32:15,709
Hey!

642
01:32:17,817 --> 01:32:19,515
Worship, Gurney.

643
01:32:20,822 --> 01:32:22,155
They used to be friends.

644
01:32:23,583 --> 01:32:24,922
Now they're followers.

645
01:32:25,058 --> 01:32:27,025
<i>Muad'Dib,</i> the Prophet.

646
01:32:27,160 --> 01:32:28,992
Why is that a bad thing? Use it.

647
01:32:29,127 --> 01:32:30,994
It's not that simple.

648
01:32:31,130 --> 01:32:33,998
You have the power to avenge
your father, and you're afraid to use it?

649
01:32:34,134 --> 01:32:36,334
Spice opened my mind, Gurney.

650
01:32:37,102 --> 01:32:38,633
I can foresee things.

651
01:32:40,440 --> 01:32:44,068
If I go South, all my
visions lead to horror.

652
01:32:44,203 --> 01:32:47,812
Billions of corpses
scattered across the galaxy.

653
01:32:47,948 --> 01:32:49,446
All dying because of me.

654
01:32:50,281 --> 01:32:51,613
Because you lose control.

655
01:32:53,480 --> 01:32:54,748
Because I gain it.

656
01:33:13,435 --> 01:33:14,801
That's a lot of water.

657
01:33:17,370 --> 01:33:18,706
Chani.

658
01:33:18,842 --> 01:33:20,642
What? Look
at him, he's hopeless.

659
01:33:21,309 --> 01:33:22,446
He's family.

660
01:33:25,917 --> 01:33:26,917
Really?

661
01:33:54,778 --> 01:33:57,481
No need to be a prophet
to see what's ahead.

662
01:34:00,218 --> 01:34:01,749
Your path leads to war.

663
01:34:03,319 --> 01:34:04,587
You know that.

664
01:34:06,993 --> 01:34:08,857
So, war is coming.

665
01:34:08,993 --> 01:34:12,863
What will you do when you
feel its breath upon your neck?

666
01:34:16,295 --> 01:34:18,663
If you don't want to raise
an army in the South,

667
01:34:18,799 --> 01:34:20,636
you may still have an option.

668
01:34:23,977 --> 01:34:25,003
Fire power...

669
01:34:26,541 --> 01:34:28,413
which you don't have.

670
01:34:30,379 --> 01:34:31,548
And here I am.

671
01:34:35,820 --> 01:34:38,555
I know where your father
hid the family atomics.

672
01:34:43,762 --> 01:34:46,761
Every House
possesses an atomic arsenal.

673
01:34:48,136 --> 01:34:50,061
I thought ours had been lost.

674
01:34:52,133 --> 01:34:54,901
It's huge, Chani. It
could change everything.

675
01:34:59,976 --> 01:35:03,547
I could aim the bombs
at the main spice fields.

676
01:35:05,115 --> 01:35:08,717
He who can destroy a
thing has the real control of it.

677
01:35:10,050 --> 01:35:11,885
So, you can
control it and not us?

678
01:35:13,955 --> 01:35:15,955
You promised me
you didn't want power.

679
01:35:17,664 --> 01:35:19,563
No matter what I do,
you still don't trust me.

680
01:35:19,699 --> 01:35:22,665
'Cause you're a
foreigner. Like your friend.

681
01:35:25,006 --> 01:35:26,603
I'm not a foreigner.

682
01:35:34,211 --> 01:35:35,377
Not to me.

683
01:35:35,512 --> 01:35:37,383
But to the desert, you are.

684
01:35:38,283 --> 01:35:40,485
My allegiance is to you.

685
01:35:41,153 --> 01:35:42,252
To the Fremen.

686
01:35:42,388 --> 01:35:44,390
I'm doing this for all of us.

687
01:35:45,652 --> 01:35:46,722
Do you believe me?

688
01:35:55,267 --> 01:35:56,534
I'll talk to Stilgar.

689
01:36:04,439 --> 01:36:05,642
There.

690
01:36:09,680 --> 01:36:13,078
It's right under
everybody's noses.

691
01:36:14,350 --> 01:36:15,513
Not clever.

692
01:36:15,648 --> 01:36:17,116
That's the idea.

693
01:36:17,252 --> 01:36:19,854
Nobody would ever look in
there because it's obvious.

694
01:36:22,329 --> 01:36:24,192
Not clever.

695
01:36:24,327 --> 01:36:25,693
Did you find it?

696
01:36:25,829 --> 01:36:28,098
I didn't look for it.

697
01:36:28,234 --> 01:36:29,699
How many heads exactly?

698
01:36:31,164 --> 01:36:33,505
Enough to blow
up the whole planet.

699
01:36:36,374 --> 01:36:37,938
It's a figure of speech.

700
01:36:39,641 --> 01:36:40,875
You know what I mean.

701
01:37:03,263 --> 01:37:05,570
Only with
your genetic heritage.

702
01:37:45,042 --> 01:37:48,439
Your
great-great-grandfather's legacy.

703
01:37:48,575 --> 01:37:52,683
The 92 original Atreides
family's atomic warheads.

704
01:37:55,420 --> 01:37:58,788
Now that, that is power.

705
01:38:05,258 --> 01:38:09,561
Imperial
Diary. Year 10,191.

706
01:38:09,696 --> 01:38:11,869
Eighth comment.

707
01:38:12,005 --> 01:38:15,566
Reports from the south
of Arrakis arrive rarely.

708
01:38:15,701 --> 01:38:19,305
<i>These are barren, burnt
lands hidden by sandstorms</i>

709
01:38:19,441 --> 01:38:22,108
<i>which stretch a thousand
miles across the equator.</i>

710
01:38:23,914 --> 01:38:27,550
<i>Nothing can live
there without faith.</i>

711
01:38:27,685 --> 01:38:32,151
<i>Which is why our Bene Gesserit
missionaries have been so productive there.</i>

712
01:38:35,295 --> 01:38:38,157
<i>Through them, we are receiving
reports of a mysterious figure</i>

713
01:38:38,292 --> 01:38:40,060
<i>taking grip on the imaginations</i>

714
01:38:40,195 --> 01:38:43,669
<i>of the Southern
fundamentalist tribes.</i>

715
01:38:43,804 --> 01:38:47,139
<i>A new Reverend
Mother from the North...</i>

716
01:38:47,274 --> 01:38:51,477
<i>spreading word of the imminent
arrival of the</i> Lisan al-Gaib,

717
01:38:51,612 --> 01:38:54,372
<i>"The Voice from
the Outer World."</i>

718
01:38:54,508 --> 01:38:57,677
<i>With religious fervor
rising in the South,</i>

719
01:38:57,813 --> 01:39:01,512
<i>and</i> Muad'Dib <i>strangling
spice production in the North,</i>

720
01:39:01,647 --> 01:39:05,558
<i>everything points to
the escalation of war.</i>

721
01:39:35,748 --> 01:39:36,820
Quiet.

722
01:41:25,662 --> 01:41:27,161
Listen carefully.

723
01:41:27,296 --> 01:41:28,898
Soon a man is going
to visit your temple

724
01:41:29,034 --> 01:41:31,668
and he may want you
to perform the rites.

725
01:41:31,803 --> 01:41:34,635
Reverend Mother,
it is forbidden.

726
01:41:40,073 --> 01:41:42,110
Let him try!

727
01:42:26,019 --> 01:42:27,386
What the hell?

728
01:42:30,791 --> 01:42:32,226
Chani!

729
01:42:38,001 --> 01:42:39,497
Chani!

730
01:42:43,573 --> 01:42:44,573
Chani.

731
01:42:54,519 --> 01:42:55,914
Sietch Tabr.

732
01:43:20,310 --> 01:43:22,210
Old fashioned artillery.

733
01:43:23,349 --> 01:43:24,982
Genius.

734
01:43:25,117 --> 01:43:27,645
We're literally melting
rock on their heads.

735
01:43:27,780 --> 01:43:30,717
I want to go on the
ground. Prepare my troops.

736
01:43:30,853 --> 01:43:34,119
My Lord. I would recommend you
stay inside. There was...

737
01:43:34,255 --> 01:43:36,294
Bring his body to my quarters.

738
01:43:37,356 --> 01:43:39,391
My poor darlings are hungry.

739
01:43:39,527 --> 01:43:41,592
There was no food
for them on the flight.

740
01:43:43,000 --> 01:43:45,332
What
are you doing here?

741
01:43:45,467 --> 01:43:48,605
It's early morning. What
are you doing here?

742
01:43:48,740 --> 01:43:50,509
Kiss my feet, brother.

743
01:43:50,644 --> 01:43:51,665
I'm gonna eviscerate your...

744
01:43:57,512 --> 01:44:00,380
You
humiliated our family.

745
01:44:01,521 --> 01:44:03,284
You humiliated me.

746
01:44:04,291 --> 01:44:05,350
Kiss...

747
01:44:05,486 --> 01:44:07,486
or die.

748
01:44:17,767 --> 01:44:19,069
We're even now.

749
01:44:24,839 --> 01:44:27,880
Embarrass
our family one more time...

750
01:44:28,945 --> 01:44:30,311
it will be the last.

751
01:45:04,877 --> 01:45:07,617
They didn't even
engage on the ground,

752
01:45:07,753 --> 01:45:09,819
like honorable fighters.

753
01:45:42,251 --> 01:45:45,186
<i>Usul,</i> in the South...

754
01:45:45,322 --> 01:45:48,026
only leaders are
allowed to speak.

755
01:45:49,129 --> 01:45:51,688
- You must take my place.
- I can't do that.

756
01:45:51,824 --> 01:45:54,626
It is a good time to
cross blades with me.

757
01:45:54,761 --> 01:45:58,165
I am weak. I am an
easy kill, <i>Muad'Dib.</i>

758
01:45:58,300 --> 01:46:00,065
I'd rather cut off my own hand.

759
01:46:00,200 --> 01:46:02,733
We need you. We need the
<i>Lisan al-Gaib</i> to lead our people.

760
01:46:02,869 --> 01:46:04,702
You know what I
think of all that, Stilgar.

761
01:46:04,837 --> 01:46:07,639
I don't care what
you believe. I believe.

762
01:46:22,025 --> 01:46:23,490
I didn't see it coming.

763
01:46:25,196 --> 01:46:27,131
The Harkonnens aren't done here.

764
01:46:28,033 --> 01:46:30,062
They just went back to reload.

765
01:46:30,198 --> 01:46:31,970
We're setting thumpers.

766
01:46:32,105 --> 01:46:33,389
We're moving
everyone to the South.

767
01:46:33,469 --> 01:46:35,273
I'll stay behind and
cover your retreat.

768
01:46:35,409 --> 01:46:38,043
- What are you talking about?
- Chani, I can't go with you.

769
01:46:38,711 --> 01:46:39,903
You know why.

770
01:46:40,038 --> 01:46:41,958
- I'll stay, too.
- Nobody stays but me.

771
01:46:42,043 --> 01:46:44,714
- Paul.
- That's an order, Gurney Halleck! Go South!

772
01:46:44,849 --> 01:46:46,216
Protect my mother.

773
01:46:48,451 --> 01:46:49,742
- My Lord.
<i>- Muad'Dib.</i>

774
01:46:59,627 --> 01:47:01,660
He's afraid of the
fundamentalists.

775
01:47:02,999 --> 01:47:04,201
And he should be.

776
01:47:17,446 --> 01:47:19,051
<i>Don't resist.</i>

777
01:47:26,088 --> 01:47:27,752
Talk to me, Jamis.

778
01:47:38,436 --> 01:47:42,506
<i>You
see only fragments.</i>

779
01:47:42,641 --> 01:47:46,771
<i>You cannot see the future
without seeing the past.</i>

780
01:47:48,541 --> 01:47:53,280
<i>To unlock your mind, you
need to drink the Water of Life...</i>

781
01:47:53,415 --> 01:47:56,550
<i>and you will see everything.</i>

782
01:47:59,960 --> 01:48:03,656
<i>A good hunter always
climbs the highest dune before his hunt.</i>

783
01:48:05,062 --> 01:48:06,428
<i>He needs to see...</i>

784
01:48:08,198 --> 01:48:09,860
<i>as far as he can see.</i>

785
01:48:15,070 --> 01:48:16,405
You need to see.

786
01:48:18,873 --> 01:48:21,311
<i>You must
drink the Water of Life.</i>

787
01:48:22,411 --> 01:48:24,314
<i>Your mind, it's gonna open,</i>

788
01:48:26,347 --> 01:48:28,252
<i>and you will see.</i>

789
01:48:46,436 --> 01:48:48,569
The world has
made choices for us.

790
01:48:53,476 --> 01:48:55,141
If I go South, I might lose you.

791
01:48:55,277 --> 01:48:57,248
You will never lose me,

792
01:48:58,345 --> 01:48:59,712
Paul Atreides.

793
01:49:01,419 --> 01:49:03,914
Not as long as you
stay who you are.

794
01:49:11,329 --> 01:49:13,224
I'll cross the storms with you.

795
01:49:13,359 --> 01:49:14,826
Go South.

796
01:49:16,035 --> 01:49:17,697
Bring your people to safety.

797
01:49:23,639 --> 01:49:26,541
And then I will do
what must be done.

798
01:49:50,703 --> 01:49:51,769
Where?

799
01:49:51,904 --> 01:49:54,167
Spy. Left behind.

800
01:49:54,303 --> 01:49:55,937
No trace of the others.

801
01:49:56,072 --> 01:49:58,903
They've gone
South to hide in the storms.

802
01:50:03,547 --> 01:50:05,182
Send this message to the Baron.

803
01:50:05,318 --> 01:50:07,511
The North is
liberated and secured.

804
01:50:07,646 --> 01:50:10,083
Harvest spice at will.

805
01:50:10,219 --> 01:50:11,751
Yes, na-Baron.

806
01:50:26,099 --> 01:50:29,771
You killed nine of my
men with one single blade.

807
01:50:31,242 --> 01:50:32,771
She won't talk.

808
01:50:32,906 --> 01:50:34,774
Tell her that's fine.

809
01:50:34,909 --> 01:50:37,546
I already know
everything I need to know.

810
01:50:45,354 --> 01:50:47,391
Only pleasure remains.

811
01:52:52,552 --> 01:52:56,652
<i>Now
that you can see our past,</i>

812
01:52:59,720 --> 01:53:02,988
<i>you can see your future.</i>

813
01:53:23,815 --> 01:53:27,585
<i>Brother,
my dearest brother,</i>

814
01:53:27,720 --> 01:53:30,719
<i>you are not prepared
for what is to come.</i>

815
01:53:32,154 --> 01:53:35,559
<i>You'll now learn the
truth about our family.</i>

816
01:53:35,694 --> 01:53:39,464
<i>And it will hurt
you to the core.</i>

817
01:53:40,999 --> 01:53:42,661
Paul...

818
01:53:42,797 --> 01:53:46,064
<i>Don't worry. I'm with you.</i>

819
01:53:47,402 --> 01:53:48,968
I love you.

820
01:54:01,913 --> 01:54:03,521
Find them.

821
01:54:32,745 --> 01:54:33,947
Paul?

822
01:54:34,514 --> 01:54:35,751
Paul.

823
01:54:37,784 --> 01:54:40,287
I'm here. I'm here. Hey.

824
01:54:43,790 --> 01:54:45,255
What happened?

825
01:54:46,627 --> 01:54:48,126
What happened?

826
01:54:58,572 --> 01:55:00,007
He's dead.

827
01:55:00,142 --> 01:55:02,980
His vital signs are so
low, they can't be detected.

828
01:55:03,115 --> 01:55:04,279
But he's alive.

829
01:55:04,415 --> 01:55:06,111
What did you do to him?

830
01:55:07,180 --> 01:55:09,384
No, not that. Why
would he do that?

831
01:55:09,519 --> 01:55:10,519
Why would you do that?

832
01:55:19,460 --> 01:55:23,165
Chani, his body is fighting the
poison and he needs your help.

833
01:55:23,300 --> 01:55:24,701
You do it.

834
01:55:25,667 --> 01:55:26,667
You did this to him.

835
01:55:26,802 --> 01:55:28,368
You did this to your own son!

836
01:55:28,503 --> 01:55:29,503
You do it!

837
01:55:29,603 --> 01:55:31,339
Fix it yourself.

838
01:55:31,474 --> 01:55:34,904
Chani, you might not believe in
the prophecy, but you're a part of it.

839
01:55:35,040 --> 01:55:36,647
You're the poison.

840
01:55:36,782 --> 01:55:39,380
You and your lies.
Why would you do this?

841
01:55:39,515 --> 01:55:40,882
Do it.

842
01:56:05,237 --> 01:56:06,842
Desert Spring tears.

843
01:56:30,934 --> 01:56:34,270
<i>Kwisatz Haderach,</i>

844
01:56:34,406 --> 01:56:38,238
<i>climb up. Arise.</i>

845
01:56:47,817 --> 01:56:49,819
<i>Usul,</i> I'm here. I'm here.

846
01:56:58,960 --> 01:57:00,557
Are you okay?

847
01:57:00,693 --> 01:57:01,897
Yes.

848
01:57:10,804 --> 01:57:11,835
Are you sure?

849
01:57:16,216 --> 01:57:17,649
Thanks to you.

850
01:58:03,092 --> 01:58:04,894
I'm sorry about Chani.

851
01:58:06,191 --> 01:58:08,293
She'll come to understand.

852
01:58:08,994 --> 01:58:10,427
I've seen it.

853
01:58:11,866 --> 01:58:13,733
You can see?

854
01:58:13,869 --> 01:58:16,334
The visions are clear now.

855
01:58:18,305 --> 01:58:22,307
I see possible
futures. All at once.

856
01:58:23,275 --> 01:58:26,716
Our enemies are all around us.

857
01:58:26,852 --> 01:58:29,380
And in so many
futures, they prevail.

858
01:58:30,115 --> 01:58:32,185
But I do see a way.

859
01:58:33,186 --> 01:58:35,793
There is a narrow way through.

860
01:58:45,868 --> 01:58:47,904
I saw our bloodline, Mother.

861
01:58:48,969 --> 01:58:50,500
Written across time.

862
01:59:02,782 --> 01:59:05,988
<i>You are the daughter of
Baron Vladimir Harkonnen.</i>

863
01:59:08,692 --> 01:59:10,289
Did my father know?

864
01:59:16,135 --> 01:59:19,496
I didn't know myself, until
I took the worm's poison.

865
01:59:27,171 --> 01:59:29,011
We're Harkonnens.

866
01:59:32,883 --> 01:59:35,149
So this is how we'll survive.

867
01:59:36,720 --> 01:59:38,350
By being Harkonnens.

868
02:01:15,180 --> 02:01:16,415
We must talk.

869
02:01:18,255 --> 02:01:21,055
Stilgar, you can stop
this. Do you hear me?

870
02:01:21,191 --> 02:01:22,788
You have the power to stop this.

871
02:01:22,923 --> 02:01:24,325
Northern woman!

872
02:01:24,460 --> 02:01:26,249
You are not allowed to
speak inside the circle.

873
02:01:26,329 --> 02:01:27,952
If you want to speak,
you know what to do.

874
02:01:28,032 --> 02:01:31,430
Stilgar, please.
For Arrakis' sake.

875
02:01:43,950 --> 02:01:46,782
This prophecy is
how they enslave us!

876
02:01:46,917 --> 02:01:48,918
How they dominate...

877
02:01:49,054 --> 02:01:50,755
You'll get yourself in trouble.

878
02:01:50,890 --> 02:01:52,219
This is none of your business.

879
02:01:52,355 --> 02:01:54,255
Rabban Harkonnen
himself killed my family.

880
02:01:54,390 --> 02:01:56,253
He gave me this scar
to remember him by.

881
02:01:56,388 --> 02:01:58,527
This is all of my business.

882
02:02:45,438 --> 02:02:47,438
Only tribe leaders can speak.

883
02:02:47,574 --> 02:02:49,573
If you wish to share your voice,

884
02:02:49,708 --> 02:02:52,542
you must take his
place by defeating him

885
02:02:52,678 --> 02:02:54,980
and returning his
water to the well.

886
02:02:55,116 --> 02:02:59,089
You think I'm stupid enough to
deprive myself of the best of us?

887
02:03:03,125 --> 02:03:05,155
Take my life, <i>Usul.</i>

888
02:03:05,291 --> 02:03:07,224
It is the only way.

889
02:03:07,359 --> 02:03:09,192
I'm pointing the way!

890
02:03:11,704 --> 02:03:12,933
Slow down.

891
02:03:48,602 --> 02:03:51,042
But you think you
could have a chance.

892
02:04:34,916 --> 02:04:36,245
Dune.

893
02:04:36,381 --> 02:04:37,749
<i>Lisan al-Gaib!</i>

894
02:04:37,884 --> 02:04:40,217
<i>Lisan
al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib!</i>

895
02:04:41,826 --> 02:04:43,259
<i>Lisan al-Gaib!</i>

896
02:04:54,235 --> 02:04:55,235
<i>Muad'Dib!</i>

897
02:04:55,337 --> 02:04:57,405
<i>Muad'Dib.</i>

898
02:05:21,563 --> 02:05:23,827
This is my father's
ducal signet.

899
02:05:33,806 --> 02:05:36,712
I am Paul
<i>Muad'Dib</i> Atreides,

900
02:05:36,847 --> 02:05:38,677
Duke of Arrakis.

901
02:05:47,754 --> 02:05:49,392
<i>Lisan al-Gaib!</i>

902
02:05:49,527 --> 02:05:51,522
<i>Lisan
al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib!</i>

903
02:05:51,657 --> 02:05:55,691
<i>Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib!</i>

904
02:05:55,826 --> 02:05:58,628
<i>Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib!</i>

905
02:05:58,763 --> 02:06:01,631
<i>Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib!</i>

906
02:06:01,766 --> 02:06:04,942
<i>Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib!</i>

907
02:06:05,077 --> 02:06:08,139
<i>Lisan al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib!</i>

908
02:06:08,275 --> 02:06:09,906
<i>Lisan al-Gaib!</i>

909
02:06:47,045 --> 02:06:49,715
Paul
Atreides is still alive.

910
02:06:51,286 --> 02:06:52,982
He challenges my father.

911
02:06:54,259 --> 02:06:56,227
You've never been on Arrakis.

912
02:06:57,494 --> 02:06:59,393
It's quite impressive.
You'll see.

913
02:06:59,528 --> 02:07:01,026
Was this all upon your advice?

914
02:07:01,161 --> 02:07:02,895
What?

915
02:07:03,031 --> 02:07:05,963
Did you counsel my father
to exterminate the Atreides?

916
02:07:06,098 --> 02:07:09,537
Of course I did. Why else
would it have happened?

917
02:07:09,672 --> 02:07:12,008
You tried to sacrifice
an entire bloodline.

918
02:07:12,144 --> 02:07:13,904
And I was right to do it.

919
02:07:14,039 --> 02:07:17,278
The <i>Kwisatz Haderach</i>
is a form of power

920
02:07:17,414 --> 02:07:19,541
that our world has not yet seen.

921
02:07:19,677 --> 02:07:22,181
The ultimate power.

922
02:07:22,317 --> 02:07:23,846
For ninety generations,

923
02:07:23,981 --> 02:07:25,954
we have supervised
House Atreides.

924
02:07:26,089 --> 02:07:29,225
They were promising, but they
were becoming dangerously defiant.

925
02:07:29,361 --> 02:07:32,692
Their bloodline had
to be terminated.

926
02:07:32,828 --> 02:07:35,194
That is why we have put
many bloodlines at work.

927
02:07:35,329 --> 02:07:36,261
Several prospects.

928
02:07:36,397 --> 02:07:37,932
But it's backfired.

929
02:07:38,068 --> 02:07:39,468
Paul is alive.

930
02:07:39,603 --> 02:07:41,283
And if he defeats
Feyd-Rautha, my father...

931
02:07:41,367 --> 02:07:45,674
Your father will lose the
throne no matter who prevails.

932
02:07:45,810 --> 02:07:48,712
But there is one way your
family can remain in power

933
02:07:48,847 --> 02:07:52,481
and, through you, the
continuation of our stewardship.

934
02:07:53,379 --> 02:07:55,418
One. Way.

935
02:07:56,053 --> 02:07:58,049
Are you prepared?

936
02:07:58,185 --> 02:08:01,292
You've been preparing me
my whole life, Reverend Mother.

937
02:08:03,395 --> 02:08:05,795
You're heading
north with the others?

938
02:08:05,931 --> 02:08:07,356
I'm Fedaykin.

939
02:08:07,492 --> 02:08:10,298
I follow my leaders. If
fighting goes north, I go north.

940
02:08:10,433 --> 02:08:11,713
Paul didn't have
a choice, Chani.

941
02:08:11,829 --> 02:08:14,367
I won't be fighting for him.

942
02:08:14,502 --> 02:08:15,999
I'm fighting for my people.

943
02:08:19,675 --> 02:08:21,708
I came to wish you best of luck.

944
02:08:22,773 --> 02:08:24,546
I'd wish you the same,

945
02:08:26,319 --> 02:08:28,077
but it seems you've
won your battle.

946
02:08:51,209 --> 02:08:52,706
He took the bait.

947
02:08:59,044 --> 02:09:01,385
The
Emperor's very obliging.

948
02:09:02,219 --> 02:09:03,981
He's right on time.

949
02:09:37,089 --> 02:09:38,950
What is he doing here?

950
02:09:39,085 --> 02:09:41,590
I brought spice
production under control.

951
02:09:44,557 --> 02:09:45,924
What do we do?

952
02:09:47,092 --> 02:09:49,896
Send messages to
the Great Houses.

953
02:09:50,031 --> 02:09:53,965
Tell them that Arrakis is
under Sardaukar attack.

954
02:09:54,100 --> 02:09:57,166
Tell them, their future
hangs in the balance.

955
02:10:24,130 --> 02:10:26,734
When the
storm hits this ridge,

956
02:10:26,869 --> 02:10:29,032
Gurney will open the
way for you, Stilgar,

957
02:10:29,167 --> 02:10:31,539
so you can enter the
basin from the West

958
02:10:31,675 --> 02:10:33,905
and distract their
defense systems.

959
02:10:34,040 --> 02:10:35,740
Chani, I want you
and your Fedaykin

960
02:10:35,876 --> 02:10:37,580
to then attack from the East,

961
02:10:38,347 --> 02:10:40,077
inside the basin.

962
02:10:40,212 --> 02:10:42,417
I'll strike from the
North, head on,

963
02:10:42,552 --> 02:10:44,519
with the Fundamentalist troops.

964
02:10:44,655 --> 02:10:47,391
And I'll serve
Arrakeen for dessert.

965
02:10:47,526 --> 02:10:49,889
Remember, I need
the Emperor alive.

966
02:11:59,295 --> 02:12:01,292
Baron,

967
02:12:01,428 --> 02:12:06,164
do you have any idea who
this <i>Muad'Dib</i> could be?

968
02:12:06,299 --> 02:12:09,370
Some fanatic, your
Majesty. That's all we know.

969
02:12:09,506 --> 02:12:11,403
More. More. Give me more.

970
02:12:11,539 --> 02:12:12,573
He's a madman!

971
02:12:12,708 --> 02:12:14,875
- Mad?
- All Fremen are mad.

972
02:12:17,043 --> 02:12:19,178
That's all you know?

973
02:12:19,314 --> 02:12:20,979
Really?

974
02:12:21,115 --> 02:12:23,048
<i>Muad'Dib</i> is dead.

975
02:12:25,152 --> 02:12:28,258
Or he went hiding in
the Southern storms

976
02:12:28,393 --> 02:12:29,960
which means the same thing.

977
02:12:30,856 --> 02:12:32,055
Your Majesty,

978
02:12:32,191 --> 02:12:33,628
the sand storm
that's approaching

979
02:12:33,764 --> 02:12:36,059
threatens the
integrity of our shields.

980
02:12:36,195 --> 02:12:38,098
We recommend
going back into orbit.

981
02:12:38,234 --> 02:12:40,604
Well, the mountains will
protect us from most of it,

982
02:12:41,437 --> 02:12:42,837
your Majesty.

983
02:12:44,235 --> 02:12:48,478
Baron, have you
ever investigated

984
02:12:48,613 --> 02:12:51,845
the south regions of Arrakis?

985
02:12:51,981 --> 02:12:54,582
Well, the entire
region is uninhabitable.

986
02:12:54,717 --> 02:12:57,113
It's well known, your Majesty.

987
02:12:57,249 --> 02:13:01,458
Your uninhabited South

988
02:13:01,594 --> 02:13:04,559
exhibits evidence
of human activity.

989
02:13:04,694 --> 02:13:06,894
I wasn't aware of this.

990
02:13:07,029 --> 02:13:09,461
I swear to you, I wasn't
aware of any of this.

991
02:13:14,573 --> 02:13:16,200
<i>Muad'Dib</i> is alive.

992
02:13:17,472 --> 02:13:18,873
I must find him.

993
02:14:39,322 --> 02:14:40,823
Fire!

994
02:15:20,291 --> 02:15:22,660
Sardaukar! On guard!

995
02:19:36,513 --> 02:19:37,713
Sardaukar!

996
02:20:43,016 --> 02:20:44,582
Grandfather.

997
02:21:06,503 --> 02:21:08,309
You die like an animal.

998
02:21:39,337 --> 02:21:40,572
<i>Muad'Dib.</i>

999
02:23:10,064 --> 02:23:11,366
Rabban!

1000
02:23:22,278 --> 02:23:24,247
Look who's back from the dead.

1001
02:23:38,392 --> 02:23:41,924
For my Duke, and my friends.

1002
02:24:47,361 --> 02:24:48,595
Warships.

1003
02:24:50,935 --> 02:24:52,027
The Great Houses.

1004
02:24:53,405 --> 02:24:55,766
Gurney, it's time.
Bring the prisoners.

1005
02:24:55,901 --> 02:24:59,402
My Lord.

1006
02:25:23,364 --> 02:25:24,730
This isn't over yet.

1007
02:25:30,536 --> 02:25:31,968
I want you to know...

1008
02:25:34,709 --> 02:25:36,907
I will love you as
long as I breathe.

1009
02:25:48,920 --> 02:25:51,592
There is a massed
armada in orbit.

1010
02:25:54,795 --> 02:25:58,263
You're facing a full
invasion, Fremen.

1011
02:25:58,398 --> 02:26:01,899
How can you be so sure
the Great Houses are here for me?

1012
02:26:07,474 --> 02:26:11,880
They may be curious to hear my
side of the story, don't you think?

1013
02:26:12,016 --> 02:26:16,782
I am Paul Atreides, son of
Leto Atreides, Duke of Arrakis.

1014
02:26:18,420 --> 02:26:19,781
- Gurney.
- My Lord.

1015
02:26:19,916 --> 02:26:22,091
Send a warning to all ships.

1016
02:26:22,227 --> 02:26:26,462
If the Great Houses attack, our
atomics will obliterate all spice fields.

1017
02:26:27,763 --> 02:26:30,159
- You're out of your mind.
- He's bluffing.

1018
02:26:30,294 --> 02:26:32,260
Consider what you're
about to do, Paul Atreides.

1019
02:26:32,396 --> 02:26:34,903
Silence!

1020
02:26:37,175 --> 02:26:38,672
Abomination.

1021
02:26:42,707 --> 02:26:44,480
Message sent, my Lord.

1022
02:26:46,114 --> 02:26:49,782
As a servant of the Imperium,
you will bow at my feet.

1023
02:26:49,918 --> 02:26:53,720
Your feet? You'll be
lucky to keep your head.

1024
02:26:56,758 --> 02:26:58,593
I'll take the hand
of your daughter.

1025
02:27:00,890 --> 02:27:02,795
She will remain safe.

1026
02:27:02,930 --> 02:27:05,468
And we will rule
together over the Empire.

1027
02:27:15,343 --> 02:27:16,776
But you...

1028
02:27:19,451 --> 02:27:21,209
You have to
answer for my father.

1029
02:27:28,656 --> 02:27:32,594
Do you know why I killed him?

1030
02:27:33,659 --> 02:27:35,530
Because he was a man

1031
02:27:35,666 --> 02:27:37,830
who believed in the
rules of the heart.

1032
02:27:38,998 --> 02:27:41,097
But the heart is
not meant to rule.

1033
02:27:42,502 --> 02:27:43,737
In other words...

1034
02:27:45,936 --> 02:27:49,809
your father was a weak man.

1035
02:27:58,686 --> 02:28:01,920
Stand or choose your champion.

1036
02:28:04,562 --> 02:28:06,188
I
am here, Atreides.

1037
02:28:08,560 --> 02:28:09,899
I need a blade.

1038
02:28:10,034 --> 02:28:11,666
Accept mine.

1039
02:28:23,273 --> 02:28:26,379
Do not stain your
hands on this animal.

1040
02:28:26,514 --> 02:28:27,742
Let me deal with him.

1041
02:28:27,878 --> 02:28:29,816
It's my burden, Gurney.

1042
02:28:48,339 --> 02:28:50,535
Why does he take such risks?

1043
02:28:50,671 --> 02:28:53,169
<i>Muad'Dib</i> leads the way.

1044
02:29:16,833 --> 02:29:20,328
I'm happy to finally
meet you, cousin.

1045
02:29:21,569 --> 02:29:24,607
Cousin? Is that right?

1046
02:29:26,471 --> 02:29:31,779
Well, you wouldn't be
the first relative I've killed.

1047
02:29:34,177 --> 02:29:37,213
May thy knife chip and shatter.

1048
02:29:40,253 --> 02:29:44,792
May
thy knife chip and shatter.

1049
02:30:35,405 --> 02:30:38,648
She's your pet?

1050
02:30:53,225 --> 02:30:56,798
Any special
attention for the pet?

1051
02:32:23,313 --> 02:32:25,414
You have fought well, Atreides.

1052
02:32:32,957 --> 02:32:34,425
<i>Lisan al-Gaib!</i>

1053
02:32:34,560 --> 02:32:37,096
<i>Lisan
al-Gaib! Lisan al-Gaib!</i>

1054
02:33:29,414 --> 02:33:32,015
<i>You
should've believed.</i>

1055
02:33:32,151 --> 02:33:33,988
<i>You chose the wrong side.</i>

1056
02:33:35,088 --> 02:33:36,452
<i>Side?</i>

1057
02:33:36,587 --> 02:33:39,555
<i>You, of all people, should know.</i>

1058
02:33:39,690 --> 02:33:44,460
<i>There are no sides...
Reverend Mother.</i>

1059
02:34:03,654 --> 02:34:05,287
The life debt has been paid.

1060
02:34:05,422 --> 02:34:07,171
Spare my father now and
I will be your willing bride.

1061
02:34:07,251 --> 02:34:08,990
The throne will be yours.

1062
02:35:41,348 --> 02:35:44,612
My Lord,
the Great Houses have answered.

1063
02:35:44,748 --> 02:35:47,055
They refuse
to honor your ascendancy.

1064
02:35:48,355 --> 02:35:51,686
We await your orders,
<i>Lisan al-Gaib.</i>
